- Hands on Projects using real world datasets
  
**Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS):**
  - Molecular Foundations of NGS
  - NGS Data Pipeline: Quality Control
  - NGS Data Pipeline: Trimming
  - NGS Data Pipeline: Genome Mapping
  - Alignment
  - De-novo, Variant calling and filtering
  - Annotation of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels
  - Hands on Projects using real world datasets
    
**RNA-seq Analysis:**
  - Quality control and Preprocessing
  - Transcriptome Mapping
  - Counting Transcripts (quantification and normalization)
  - Differential gene expression analysis
  - Visualization of expression trends using heatmaps, PCA, and volcano plots
